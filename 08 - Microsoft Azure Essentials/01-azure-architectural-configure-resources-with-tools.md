# Microsoft Azure
# 01 - Azure Architectural and Configure resources with tools.

### Instructions
Activity 1: You will create an **Azure free account** and create **1 mindmap**, you can choose to do it by hand and take a picture, or use a digital tool like draw.io, lucidchart, miro and so on; each mindmap needs to synthesize, abstract, and overall display your own understanding of the concepts.
* Favor clear keywords over long definitions
* You may use images, icons, or symbols (optional)
* Challenge yourself to **not copy-paste**, but to understand and write what you understand about the concepts

Activity 2: **Configure Azure resources with tools** such as Azure portal Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI or Azure Cloud Shell. 

<ol>
<li>Create a resource Group from Azure Portal</li>
<li>Create a Virtual Network from Azure Portal</li>
<li>Install Azure CLI</li>
<li>Create a resource Group with Azure CLI </li>
<li>Create a Virtual Network with Azure CLI </li>
<li>Install Az PowerShell module</li>
<li>Create a resource Group with PowerShell</li>
<li>Create a Virtual Network with PowerShell</li>
</ol>

Note: Use Diferentes Locations for each Resource Group.

### 1. Azure architectural components

The mind map will cover the content from the following page from the Azure fundamentals course:

- [Introduction to Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/intro-to-azure-fundamentals/)
- [Azure architecture](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/azure-architecture-fundamentals/introduction)
- [Create an Azure Account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/create-an-azure-account/)


Be sure to cover the following concepts:
*  Management Groups
*  Subscriptions
*  Regions / Region Pairs
*  Availability zones
*  Resources 
---
:warning:  The webpage from azure is a guide but be sure to also research in more sources the same information.

### 2. Configure Azure resources with tools
Deploy 3 differents resources group and a Virtual Network in each resource Group and document the commands for Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell and steps in Azure Portal.

You can use the following resources or research others that you find convenient:
* [Configure Azure resources with tools
](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/configure-azure-resources-tools/)
* [Manage services with the Azure portal
](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/tour-azure-portal/)
* [Azure services the Azure CLI can manage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/azure-services-the-azure-cli-can-manage)
* [Get started with Azure PowerShell
](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/get-started-azureps?view=azps-6.4.0)

### Expected deliverables
- MD file including a picture of your mind map and commands used to deploy your resources in Azure and a image of each resource group with the VNET.
- Additional references included
