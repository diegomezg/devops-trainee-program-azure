### Instructions
You will need an **Azure free tier account** (preferably linked to a personal email) to be able to carry out this activities.  **Note**: The free account should be linked to a subscription. You probably already have this setup from previous labs, if not, please complete this before proceeding with the following activities.<br>  
Activity 1: **Configure Azure AD, Users and assign roles**

Every Azure account has a default AD, in this task you will first practice creating a new Azure AD, then work on creating users and groups. Finally, assign a role to a user. <br>**Note**: To assign role to a group may require upgrading to a premium account, so that may not be covered with the free tier account.
