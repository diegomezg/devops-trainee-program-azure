# 04 - Azure Identity Access Management & Storage.

## Instructions
You will need an **Azure free tier account** (preferably linked to a personal email) to be able to carry out this activities.  **Note**: The free account should be linked to a subscription. You probably already have this setup from previous labs, if not, please complete this before proceeding with the following activities.<br>  
Activity 1: **Configure Azure AD, Users and assign roles**

Every Azure account has a default AD, in this task you will first practice creating a new Azure AD, then work on creating users and groups. Finally, assign a role to a user. <br>**Note**: To assign role to a group may require upgrading to a premium account, so that may not be covered with the free tier account. 


- [Create an Azure AD](iam/create-azure-ad.md)
- [Create a User and Group](iam/creat-user-group.md)
- [Assign Role to a User](iam/assign-role-user.md)



Activity 2: **Configure Azure blob storage and upload sample file**

To create a blob storage, you would need to first create a resource group, then create a storage account within the resource group.

- [Create a Resource Group from Azure Portal](iam/create-resource-group.md)
- [Create a Storage Account from the Azure Portal](iam/create-storage-account.md)
- [Upload a sample file to a blob container](iam/upload-file-blob.md)
- [Delete and restore object from blob container](iam/delete-restore-blob-file.md)
